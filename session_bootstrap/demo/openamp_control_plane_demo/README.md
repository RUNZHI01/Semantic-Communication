# 飞腾多核弱网安全语义视觉回传系统 Demo

This package ships the operator-facing local dashboard for the current repo state. It is not a disconnected mock: the backend reads the existing OpenAMP evidence package, raw probe JSON, FIT summaries, wrapper evidence, the latest live dual-path status snapshot (`session_bootstrap/reports/openamp_demo_live_dualpath_status_20260317.md`), and the trusted-current performance reports that already live under `session_bootstrap/reports/`.

The UI keeps the system story explicit:

- Current / PyTorch reconstruction remains the existing semantic-visual-return data plane
- OpenAMP is the control plane for admission, heartbeat, SAFE_STOP, and fault evidence
- headline performance quotes `4-core Linux performance mode`
- OpenAMP live cues are presented as `3-core Linux + RTOS demo mode`, not as a speedup path

## What it shows

- four-act Chinese-first operator flow: trusted state -> Current semantic visual return live -> formal comparison / performance positioning -> fault injection / recovery
- web-side board credential entry for `host / user / password / port / env_file`, stored only in the current demo-server process and reused for later actions
- board/control-plane status with explicit evidence-backed vs live-probe mode
- key OpenAMP milestones across cold boot, `STATUS_REQ/RESP`, `JOB_REQ/JOB_ACK`, heartbeat, wrapper-backed board smoke, `SAFE_STOP`, and `JOB_DONE`
- final `FIT-01`, `FIT-02`, `FIT-03` state, including `FIT-03` pre-fix FAIL -> post-fix PASS history
- trusted-current performance positioning with the data-plane/control-plane boundary called out explicitly
- default third-act baseline = `2026-03-12` archived PyTorch reference; the `2026-03-17` dual-path live status remains linked as historical evidence
- when baseline live is available, the user-facing cockpit now keeps the label on `PyTorch live` / `PyTorch signed live`; the backend JSON still preserves the technical admission mode as `legacy_sha` or `signed_manifest_v1`
- explicit mode split for the operator: `4-core Linux performance mode` vs `3-core Linux + RTOS demo mode`
- operator launch commands and source-of-truth document links

## Launch

Default local dashboard:

```bash
bash ./session_bootstrap/scripts/run_openamp_demo.sh
```

Open it at `http://127.0.0.1:8079`.
If that port is still held by an older instance of this same OpenAMP demo server, the launcher will stop it and restart cleanly. If some other service owns the port, the launcher exits with a targeted error instead of killing it.

This launches the app-layer dashboard for the Feiteng semantic visual return system. The launcher does not change the runtime split: performance headline numbers still come from `4-core Linux performance mode` reports, while OpenAMP live actions remain `3-core Linux + RTOS demo mode`.

Optional live board probe wiring:

```bash
bash ./session_bootstrap/scripts/run_openamp_demo.sh \
  --port 8090 \
  --probe-env ./session_bootstrap/config/phytium_pi_login.env
```

## Session Readiness Check

Before trying to continue the live operator flow, run the launcher-level readiness preflight first:

```bash
bash ./session_bootstrap/scripts/run_openamp_demo.sh --check-readiness
```

If you need the raw checker directly, you can still run:

```bash
python3 ./session_bootstrap/scripts/check_openamp_demo_session_readiness.py --format text
```

Default JSON output is also available for machine-readable checks:

```bash
python3 ./session_bootstrap/scripts/check_openamp_demo_session_readiness.py
```

The readiness checker reuses the same demo defaults and field contracts as the dashboard server:

- checks whether `host / user / port / password` are complete for the current session
- reports whether the probe env defaults are present and whether the effective inference env is complete
- distinguishes `docs-first only` from `can continue live probe` and `can continue live inference`
- exits with `0` when the full live operator flow is ready, `2` when readiness blockers remain

In the normal repo state, the check should explicitly report `missing password` while showing that the probe/inference defaults are already preloaded.

Optional signed-manifest demo admission for the current artifact, baseline artifact, or both:

```bash
bash ./session_bootstrap/scripts/run_openamp_demo.sh \
  --signed-manifest-file /tmp/openamp_demo_signed_admission/current.bundle.json \
  --signed-manifest-public-key /tmp/openamp_demo_signed_admission/current.public.pem \
  --baseline-signed-manifest-file /tmp/openamp_demo_signed_admission/baseline.bundle.json \
  --baseline-signed-manifest-public-key /tmp/openamp_demo_signed_admission/baseline.public.pem
```

The demo keeps the legacy path intact by default. Current and Baseline are configured independently:

- if a variant-specific signed bundle and public key are supplied, that live path switches to `signed_manifest_v1` preflight
- the signed bundle is verified locally with the supplied public key before the wrapper launches
- wrapper traces and manifests carry the signed-manifest metadata for the user-facing demo
- the live control hook now emits `SIGNED_ADMISSION_BEGIN/CHUNK/SIGNATURE/COMMIT` before the unchanged 44-byte `JOB_REQ`
- if Baseline signed admission is not configured or fails local verification, the demo stays explicit: Baseline live falls back to expected-SHA admission when available, the UI still labels that path as `PyTorch live`, and the backend state keeps `mode=legacy_sha`; otherwise the UI keeps the formal archived baseline comparison only

The same override can also be carried in the active inference env file with:

```bash
OPENAMP_DEMO_ADMISSION_MODE=signed_manifest_v1
OPENAMP_DEMO_SIGNED_MANIFEST_FILE=/tmp/openamp_demo_signed_admission/current.bundle.json
OPENAMP_DEMO_SIGNED_MANIFEST_PUBLIC_KEY=/tmp/openamp_demo_signed_admission/current.public.pem

OPENAMP_DEMO_BASELINE_ADMISSION_MODE=signed_manifest_v1
OPENAMP_DEMO_BASELINE_SIGNED_MANIFEST_FILE=/tmp/openamp_demo_signed_admission/baseline.bundle.json
OPENAMP_DEMO_BASELINE_SIGNED_MANIFEST_PUBLIC_KEY=/tmp/openamp_demo_signed_admission/baseline.public.pem
```

The dashboard stays evidence-led either way. The "探测板卡 / OpenAMP" action only runs a read-only SSH probe plus an optional cached RPMsg status query.
If `session_bootstrap/reports/openamp_demo_live_probe_latest.json` already exists, the dashboard loads that saved successful probe on startup and keeps showing it if a later in-dashboard refresh fails.

On startup, the demo now also preloads practical repo-backed defaults when they exist:

- SSH defaults: `session_bootstrap/config/phytium_pi_login.env`, else `session_bootstrap/config/phytium_pi_login.example.env`
- inference defaults for the demo line: prefer the env snapshot referenced by `session_bootstrap/reports/inference_real_reconstruction_compare_currentsafe_chunk4_refresh_20260313_1758.md`, else fall back to `session_bootstrap/config/inference_real_reconstruction_compare.2026-03-11.phytium_pi.env`
- live inference now reuses that validated env contract directly instead of rewriting `INFERENCE_CURRENT_EXPECTED_SHA256` inside the demo server

Repo-side password fields are ignored intentionally. The operator still enters the password once in the web UI, and the current demo-server process reuses it for later probe / inference / fault actions.

If you want to re-check readiness with a runtime password without starting the dashboard first, prefer the same launcher entrypoint:

```bash
bash ./session_bootstrap/scripts/run_openamp_demo.sh --check-readiness-prompt-password
```

The launcher reads the password once from stdin without echoing it, forwards it only to the readiness checker process, and does not write it back into repo files.
If you prefer the split form, this is equivalent:

```bash
bash ./session_bootstrap/scripts/run_openamp_demo.sh --check-readiness --prompt-password
```

The older explicit override still works when you intentionally want a non-interactive call:

```bash
bash ./session_bootstrap/scripts/run_openamp_demo.sh \
  --check-readiness \
  --password '<runtime-password>'
```

If the readiness retry passes and you want to launch the dashboard with one temporary runtime password, the launcher now also supports:

```bash
bash ./session_bootstrap/scripts/run_openamp_demo.sh --prompt-password
```

Direct checker usage still works when needed:

```bash
python3 ./session_bootstrap/scripts/check_openamp_demo_session_readiness.py \
  --password '<runtime-password>' \
  --format text
```

The readiness outputs only report `has_password=true/false`; they do not print the raw password back out.

## Web-side credential flow

Open the dashboard and fill the "会话接入" card:

- `主机 / IP`
- `用户名`
- `密码`
- `SSH 端口`
- optional `env 文件`

The password is kept only in memory inside the current demo server process. It is not written back to the repo.
If the startup defaults above were found, the UI prelabels which fields were preloaded and which one is still missing. In the normal repo state, `host / user / port / env_file` are already filled, so only the password must be entered before Current / Baseline attempt live execution.
Later board-facing actions reuse the same in-process session automatically:

- Act 1 trusted-state probe
- Act 2 Current semantic visual return live attempt
- Act 3 formal comparison / optional PyTorch live cue
- Act 4 RPMsg fault injection / SAFE_STOP recovery

If the board is unreachable or the env file is incomplete for inference, the UI falls back to prerecorded evidence and labels that downgrade explicitly.

## Read-only board probe

Standalone CLI:

```bash
python3 ./session_bootstrap/scripts/probe_openamp_board_status.py \
  --env ./session_bootstrap/config/phytium_pi_login.env
```

Default output:

- `session_bootstrap/reports/openamp_demo_live_probe_latest.json`

The probe only reads:

- hostname / user
- `/sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc*/state`
- `/dev/rpmsg*`
- RPMsg channel names under `/sys/bus/rpmsg/devices/*/name`
- `/lib/firmware/openamp_core0.elf` size and SHA256

It does not reboot the board, does not send `JOB_REQ`, and does not modify firmware/runtime state.

## Host and slave side scope

Host side inputs:

- `session_bootstrap/reports/openamp_control_plane_evidence_package_20260315/`
- `session_bootstrap/reports/openamp_demo_live_dualpath_status_20260317.md`
- raw board probes such as `openamp_job_done_real_probe_20260315_001.json`
- FIT bundles under `openamp_*_fit_*`
- `session_bootstrap/scripts/openamp_control_wrapper.py`
- `session_bootstrap/scripts/openamp_rpmsg_bridge.py`
- trusted-current performance reports for SHA `6f236b07f9b0bf981b6762ddb72449e23332d2d92c76b38acdcadc1d9b536dc1`

App-layer interpretation boundary:

- Current / PyTorch reconstruction is the data plane shown to the evaluator
- OpenAMP evidence is the control/safety plane shown alongside it
- `remoteproc0=running` live cues must be explained as `3-core Linux + RTOS demo mode`
- performance headline numbers stay attached to the separate `4-core Linux performance mode` reports

Slave/OpenAMP side assumptions:

- the board remains on the already prepared OpenAMP path
- RPMsg transport and remoteproc state are the ones validated in the existing evidence package
- the final post-fix firmware SHA in the dashboard comes from the board-backed `FIT-03` PASS bundle
- live control actions first try the SSH user's direct `/dev/rpmsg*` access, then `sudo -n` if the board already grants passwordless sudo; otherwise the demo reports an explicit board-side permission gate instead of pretending the control path ran
- if `remoteproc` has claimed one Linux CPU, the operator explains the board as `3-core Linux + RTOS demo mode`, not as a 4-core performance run

## Local verification

Recommended checks:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s ./session_bootstrap/demo/openamp_control_plane_demo/tests -p 'test_*.py'
bash ./session_bootstrap/scripts/run_openamp_demo.sh --port 8079
```

## Regression coverage snapshot

The current demo regression suite covers these public/operator-facing surfaces:

- snapshot construction in `demo_data.build_snapshot()`, including final FIT verdicts, trusted-current performance alignment, live-probe mode switching, and saved-probe labeling
- HTTP smoke coverage for `GET /api/snapshot`, `GET /api/system-status`, `POST /api/session/board-access`, `POST /api/probe-board`, `POST /api/run-inference`, `POST /api/inject-fault`, `GET /docs?path=...`, `GET /api/health`, `GET /`, `GET /app.js`, and `GET /app.css`
- localhost socket smoke coverage for `GET /api/health` that boots `DemoHTTPServer` on an ephemeral port, hits the real bound endpoint once, and shuts down cleanly when the runtime permits local socket creation
- live-probe cache behavior: startup reuse of the last successful probe artifact and preservation of that saved probe when a later refresh fails
- session credential behavior: redacted public payloads, probe reuse of saved credentials, and fallback/live inference API payload shaping
- docs endpoint guardrails for missing path, invalid repo-external path, missing file, and JSON pretty-print rendering
- direct `board_probe` unit coverage for command construction, cache helpers, and execution outcomes: password-auth SSH selection, `REMOTE_SSH_PORT` override handling, `connect_phytium_pi.sh --env ...` fallback, dedicated `load_probe_output()` checks for missing, malformed, and valid-non-dict JSON, `write_probe_output()` success-and-write-failure paths, and `run_live_probe()` success, timeout, launch/configuration failure, non-zero exit, and JSON parse-error payload shaping
- `server.main()` bootstrap coverage for both normal startup and `--probe-startup`, including `DashboardState` construction, startup probe ordering, `DemoHTTPServer` wiring, and the printed launch banner without binding a real socket

Intentional gaps and next-optional coverage:

- optional extra `board_probe` unit coverage would now be limited to rarer platform-specific shell/permission anomalies beyond the current command-construction, cache-helper, launch-failure, and result-shaping paths
- the frontend is covered as served assets only; there is no browser-level regression for DOM rendering or the in-page refresh flow
- the localhost socket smoke skips explicitly when the runtime forbids socket creation, so heavily sandboxed environments still will not exercise bind/listen despite the test existing
