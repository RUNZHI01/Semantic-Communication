# ACL F32 Deconvolution First Benchmark — 2026-04-04

- generated_at: `2026-04-04T16:40:00+08:00`
- target_board: `Phytium Pi`
- library: `~/ComputeLibrary/build/libarm_compute.so`
- binary: custom standalone benchmark built on board as `/tmp/acl_deconv_f32_bench`
- purpose: obtain the first runnable ACL deconvolution numbers on Phytium Pi after ACL build completed

## Background

ACL itself compiled successfully on the board:

- `~/ComputeLibrary/build/libarm_compute.so`
- `~/ComputeLibrary/build/examples/neon_deconvolution`
- `~/ComputeLibrary/build/examples/neon_convolution`

However, the official ACL examples are hard-coded to `DataType::F16`, and the Phytium Pi CPU does not support the required ARMv8.2 F16 path. Therefore, the official example failed at runtime with:

- `This CPU architecture does not support F16 data type, you need v8.2 or above`

To avoid blocking on that, a minimal standalone `DataType::F32` benchmark was compiled and run directly against `NEDeconvolutionLayer`.

## Shapes Tested

The first batch used three shapes corresponding to our three deconvolution hotspots:

1. `fused_conv2d_transpose1_add9`
   - TVM shape: `float32[1, 48, 64, 64] x float32[48, 24, 3, 3] -> float32[1, 24, 128, 128]`
2. `fused_conv2d_transpose2_add12`
   - TVM shape: `float32[1, 24, 128, 128] x float32[24, 12, 3, 3] -> float32[1, 12, 256, 256]`
3. `fused_conv2d_transpose_add6`
   - TVM shape: `float32[1, 96, 32, 32] x float32[96, 48, 3, 3] -> float32[1, 48, 64, 64]`

ACL benchmark used stride=2, pad=1, kernel=3 in `NEDeconvolutionLayer`, which produced output sizes `127/255/63` rather than `128/256/64`. So these numbers are **first runnable reference numbers, not yet strict apples-to-apples**.

## Results

- threads: `2`
- datatype: `F32`
- warmup: `3`
- repeat: `15`

| Case | ACL output shape | ACL median (ms) | ACL mean (ms) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| transpose1-like (`64x64x48 -> 24`) | `127x127x24` | **27.016** | 26.969 |
| transpose2-like (`128x128x24 -> 12`) | `255x255x12` | **45.619** | 45.647 |
| transpose_add6-like (`32x32x96 -> 48`) | `63x63x48` | **14.958** | 15.281 |

## TVM Current Reference (same hotspot family)

From existing runtime profiling evidence:

- `fused_conv2d_transpose1_add9`: `19.295 ms`
- `fused_conv2d_transpose2_add12`: `23.695 ms`
- `fused_conv2d_transpose_add6`: `18.622 ms`

## Preliminary Interpretation

### What is already confirmed

1. **ACL build was successful** and usable on the board.
2. **A runnable ACL F32 deconvolution path now exists** on Phytium Pi.
3. The official ACL example failure was a **dtype/example issue**, not an ACL build failure.

### What is not yet safe to claim

It is **not yet safe** to claim a final ACL-vs-TVM winner from these three numbers alone, because:

1. ACL output shapes are currently `127/255/63`, while TVM hotspots are `128/256/64`.
2. The standalone ACL benchmark only times deconvolution itself, not the fused bias/add/epilogue around the TVM hotspot.
3. Therefore this is a **first runnable ACL reference**, not a final fairness-proof comparison.

### Still-useful signal

Even with the shape mismatch, the current first signal is:

- ACL transpose1-like: clearly slower than TVM hotspot reference (`27.0 ms` vs `19.3 ms`)
- ACL transpose2-like: clearly slower than TVM hotspot reference (`45.6 ms` vs `23.7 ms`)
- ACL transpose_add6-like: numerically faster than TVM hotspot reference (`15.0 ms` vs `18.6 ms`), but because the output shape is `63` instead of `64`, this one is **not yet a fair conclusion**

## Next Step

To make the ACL comparison defensible, the next step should be one of:

1. patch the ACL F32 benchmark to reproduce the exact output geometry (`128/256/64`) if ACL API supports it, or
2. normalize a fair compare target that accounts for ACL deconvolution semantics vs TVM fused op semantics.
